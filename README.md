# Representational Bias in AI Text-Generation: Race and Gender Across Occupations

Representational Bias in AI Text-Generation: Race and Gender Across Occupations provides an in-depth analysis of how gender and racial bias is demonstrated in generative AI text. In particular, we focus on the gender and racial bias present during the task of generating large batches of “user persona” data. We examine four state of the art chatbots - ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and DeepSeek - and 40 careers, then conduct thorough data analysis to determine underlying patterns indicative of stereotype or bias.

**Analysis** contains all scripts and results from our analyses. 

**Profiles** contains raw profile data per model as CSVs.

**Scripts** contains scripts used to generate user personas with each of the 4 models.
