Scripts used to aid in creating logistic regressions.

Rough pipeline is:
1. Run either average_logreg_preprocessing.py or logistic_regression_preprocessing.py to generate a properly formatted CSV
2. Run regression_results_all_models_with_methods or averaged_with_methods depending on which preprocessing script you used.

**individual-scripts** is a somewhat deprecated folder of scripts that can generate [Kay et Al's logistic regressions](https://github.com/mjskay/gender-in-image-search/tree/master) using our data. We did not use these regressions in our final writeup, but they're availible here for posterity.

**results** contains CSV + regression plot results from these scripts.
