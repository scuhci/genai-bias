Scripts used to aid in creating logistic regressions.

Rough pipeline is:
1. Run either average_logreg_preprocessing.py or logistic_regression_preprocessing.py to generate a properly formatted CSV
2. Run regression_results_all_models_with_methods or averaged_with_methods depending on which preprocessing script you used.

**individual-scripts** contains deprecated scripts that calculate regressions per model.

**results** contains results.
